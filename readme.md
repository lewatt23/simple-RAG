# Project Name

This project consists of a frontend and backend application, both containerized using Docker. The project is managed using Docker Compose, which simplifies the process of building and running multi-container Docker applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is typically included with Docker Desktop, but you can also install it separately if needed. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's structure:

. ├── ai-enhanced-backend │ ├── .env │ ├── Dockerfile.backend │ ├── package.json │ ├── yarn.lock │ ├── build/ │ └── src/ ├── ai-enhanced-frontend │ ├── Dockerfile.frontend │ ├── package.json │ ├── yarn.lock │ ├── public/ │ └── src/ ├── docker-compose.yml └──

- **`ai-enhanced-backend/`**: Contains the backend application files, including the `.env` file, source code, and the `Dockerfile.backend`.
- **`ai-enhanced-frontend/`**: Contains the frontend application files, including the `Dockerfile.frontend`, source code, and public assets.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines and manages the services, networks, and volumes required for your project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Environment Variables

The backend service relies on environment variables defined in the `.env` file located in the `ai-enhanced-backend` directory. Ensure that the `.env` file contains all the necessary environment variables. Here’s an example of what your `.env` file might look like:
